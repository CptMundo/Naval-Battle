## Introduction

Welcome to the Naval Battle game! This is a simple Python-based game where you try to sink the computer's battleship by guessing its location on a 5x5 grid. This readme provides an overview of the game, its rules, and how to play.

## How to Play

1. Objective: The objective of the game is to sink the computer's battleship by correctly guessing its location on a 5x5 grid.

2. Attempts: You have a total of 6 attempts to guess the battleship's location.

3. Grid: The game is played on a 5x5 grid, and you will guess both the row and column where you think the battleship is located. The rows and columns are numbered from 1 to 5.

4. Winning Condition: If you guess the correct row and column where the battleship is positioned, you win the game.

5. Missed Guesses: If your guess is incorrect, the grid will mark the location with an 'X' to indicate a missed guess.

6. Repeated Guesses: If you guess a location that you've already guessed in a previous turn, it won't count as a valid guess, and you won't be penalized for repeating the same guess.

7. Losing Condition: If you use up all 6 attempts and don't successfully guess the battleship's location, you lose the game. The game will reveal the battleship's location at this point.
